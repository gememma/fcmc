# FCMC

The Functional Concurrent Machine Calculus is an implemented model of computation. This project 
was submitted as part of my university dissertation in May 2023.

## Usage

Rust is required to run this project. You can install the Rust compiler using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs).

This repository uses the `rust-toolchain` file to specify which version of the
Rust compiler should be used, which `rustup` should detect and install automatically.

Run `cargo run` to build and run the project. Run `cargo test` to run the `tests` module.
